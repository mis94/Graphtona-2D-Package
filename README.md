# Graphtona 2D Package
A 2D graphics package that draws using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_API">Windows API</a> with self-implemented drawing algorithms for various graphical shapes in C++.

This package enables users to:

- Draw straight lines
	- Using Simple DDA algorithm
	- Using Parametric line equations
	- Using Bresenham midpoint algorithm
- Draw circles
	- Using direct Cartesian method
	- Using direct Polar method
	- Using iterative polar method
	- Using Bresenham midpoint algorithm
- Draw ellipses
	- Using Bresenham midpoint algorithm
- Draw curves of different degrees
	- First degree (straight line)
	- Second degree
	- Hermite curves (third degree)
	- Bezier curves (a special case of Hermite curves)
	- Cardinal splines
- Filling algorthims
	- Convex shapes filling using scanline filling algorthim
	- Circle filling in a simpler way than scanline filling
- Clipping algorithms
	- Clipping a point according to a rectangle & circle
	- Clipping a straight line according to a rectangle & circle
